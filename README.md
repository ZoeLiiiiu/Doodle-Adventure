Project Name: 
Doodle Adventure

Project Description:
The project is a game inspired by Doodle Jump (https://doodlejump.io/). In the game, the player controls the doodle to go left or right, so that the doodle can jump on a platform and go upward. If the doodle doesn’t step on a platform, it will fall, and the game is over. The doodle can collect the coins that appear on the platform. The doodle will also get a 20-coin reward for every 1000 pixels it jumps up. Monsters may appear. If the doodle bumps on a monster, the game is over. Doodle can kill the monster by shooting bullets toward it or stepping on it. To win the game, the doodle needs to collect 100 coins.
