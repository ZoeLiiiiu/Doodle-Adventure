1.	Doodle Movement:

Description:
The doodle’s movement mimics elasticity and gravity. It is always experiencing the downward acceleration of 10 pixels per timerFired. If the doodle jumps on a platform, it will experience an upward acceleration of 50 per timerFired. Meanwhile, the vertical and horizontal speed is set to zero. The player controls the doodle by pressing the Left key or Right key. Pressing the key will generate a 20 pixel per timerFired acceleration. If the horizontal speed is not zero, the doodle will experience a horizontal resistance opposite to the movement direction. When moving leftward, the doodle will face left. When moving rightward, the doodle will face right. When shooting the bullets, the doodle will face up.

2.	Infinitely Scrolling Up/Down:

Description:
When the doodle goes higher than half of the canvas, the canvas will scroll up at the speed of half of the doodle’s speed. So, sometimes the doodle goes out of the canvas's upper bound. This is a feature to increase the difficulties of the game. Similarly, when the game is over, the canvas will scroll down until the doodle goes out of the lower bound.

3.	Normal Platforms Generation and Renew: 

Description:
At the beginning of the game, 20 platforms will be generated on canvas. The position of the platforms is random, yet the game is still winnable. That’s to say, there is at least one platform that the doodle can continue jumping on. To be counted as jumping on a platform, at least half of the doodle’s width needs to be on that platform (The nose of the doodle count as a part of the doodle’s width).
 
With the doodle going up, the canvas can scroll up infinitely. As the old platforms get out of the bound of the canvas, the new platforms will be generated, while the number of the platform will always be the same. Every 1000 pixels the doodle goes up, the number of the platform will decrease by two.

5.	Coins: 

Description: 
3 to 5 coins randomly appear on the platforms. If the doodle jumps on a platform with a coin, the doodle will get that coin, and the coin will be disappeared on the platform. As the old coins are collected by the doodle or getting out of the canvas bound, new coins will be generated. The number of coins will always be the same unless we are unable to generate enough coins. Note that a coin may appear at the same position several times.

Description: 
When the doodle gets more than 20 coins, a monster will appear every 1000 pixels while the doodle gets up. The monster will move horizontally on the screen if it doesn’t detect any platform 60 pixels below. When the monster is moving to the left, the face is facing leftward. When the monster is moving to the right, the face is facing rightward. 

If the doodle bumps a monster while jumping up, the game is over. The doodle can kill the monster by shooting a bullet toward it or stepping on it. As long as the doodle touches the monster, it will be counted as bumping on the monster if the doodle is going upward and stepping on the monster if the doodle is going downward. The killed monster will disappear.
